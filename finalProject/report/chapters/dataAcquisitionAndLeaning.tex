	\section{Data sources}
	It will be need to use two databases, the first data contain latitude, longitude for each neighborhood, and the second data contain population and rural territorial extension so on. These data will use looking for venues in Foursquare
	\section{Data cleaning}
	Data downloaded or scraped from multiple sources were combined into one table, then I will delete row columns irrelevant to the objective. There are problems with names or other data, so I should validity it for the neighborhood code and select a specific year (2015) for data amount of population.
	\section{Feature selection}
	After data cleaning, I will find related places with restaurants, GYM and shopping mall since these places are the most visited for people interesting in healthy food.
